    <string name="ged_changed_in_2014">IMPORTANT: The GED® test changed in 2014. If you did not pass by December 31, 2013, you must start over with the new test.</string>

    <string name="testing_guidelines">1) Arrive early and take a moment to relax and reduce your anxiety.\n
2) Listen attentively to instructions given by the instructor.\n
3) Read the directions very carefully.\n
4) Plan how you will use the time for the test. Bring your watch and pay close attention to the passing time. Do not let the pace of others cause you to be nervous.\n
5) Do not let difficult questions affect your attitude. Eliminate any choices that you can, then make your best guess and move on.\n
6) Rely on your knowledge and do not watch for patterns. Noticing that the last four answers were “c” is not a good reason to change your answer. Change answers only when you are certain. The answer which comes to mind first is often correct.\n
7) When answering the essay question, organize your thoughts before you begin to write. A short outline on your “draft paper” will improve your thinking. You should have a main idea or issue, several supporting issues and examples to illustrate the issues.\n
8) When answering the essay, paraphrase the original question to form your introductory statement. This benefits you in two ways. First, it helps you get the question straight in your mind. Second, it helps the reader understand how you understood the question and see your perspective.\n
9) When answering the essay, write your answer clearly, so the reader will be able to decode your writing and understand your ideas. Remember to summarize your answer briefly at the end of your writing.</string>
